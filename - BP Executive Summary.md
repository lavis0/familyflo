### Draft v2
FamilyFlo is revolutionizing maternal care by providing thoughtfully curated, stage-specific subscription boxes to support mothers throughout their pregnancy journey and beyond. While our product serves mothers, and will often be bought by the mother, our focus market is the family and friends connected to the mother. This will be in the form of a gift subscription so that the buyer could provide a thoughtful gift that strongly impacts the mothers life. Our product, 'The Bump Bag', will serve as a foundation for their journeys, providing the essential items, included all the unexpected ones, as well as information. This will be served directly to the mothers door every three months. Our personalisation to each stage of pregnancy and beyond, our focus on education, our comprehensiveness and our eco-friendliness allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Our education forum is free to the public, allowing them to explore the need of particular products and understand each stage of their pregnancy in more depth. This allows each mother to delve deeper into the aspects that they find important, so that they can further personalise their journey. The Bump Bag comes in three tiers, Essentials (£XX), Goodies (£XX) and Complete Package (£XX). These products will be available at monthly costs, or a reduced cost one-time purchase of the entire subscription cycle (18 months). Any of these products will allow mothers to have less to worry about, and more to be excited about. Moving forward, we would want to become more comprehensive and a single touch-point for the mothers needs outside of hospital care and food.

### Draft v1
The business is providing subscription-based giftbox that contains relevant materials at each stage of their pregnancy and after the baby is born. This would start at 9 months before birth, and 9 months after, with each giftbox being delivered every three months. They will provide essentials at each stage, that the mother should be unaware of or perhaps does not own yet. They should come every three months so that the mother doesn't have too much to learn, but can still enjoy the new products. There will be different tiers of the box, either in different levels of comprehensiveness (essentials, extras or a combination). We aim to target sales at the people around the mothers, so that they can purchase it as a gift instead which would in turn increase our potential market. Our mission is to make the birth process something that's focused on happy feelings, and not on a stressful process of figuring out all the random things you might need to ease the process. Our USP is that we take the mother through the whole journey and focus on education as well as value from products. Our competitors often strongly niche or only offer a single package.

We will have a learning database so you can understand whether each product applies to you for free. This will be a learning hub for the families that would like to know more but have poor access to resources.
