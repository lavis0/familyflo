## Instructions
### Formatting your research
In the following material, I will suggest if each cost is a one-time cost (**O**), variable cost (**V**) or a recurring cost (**R**). I have split the costs into several categories, so approaching the contributing costs to the categories is easier for viewing and comprehension. Please put the frequency of the cost as a number (in months).

### Example
i.e. paying the CEO £1200 per year would actually be paid monthly, so it would be 1R £100.
i.e. for shipping, we might say there is a range in what it could cost, between £100-200 a month, so it would be 1V £100-200.

### Variable costs in more detail
In the case that there would be no cost, please research how much it would cost if we did need it too.
For shipping, it *could* follow like this (don't use this to inform your research):
1. No sales, £0 shipping.
2. <100 sales p.m., price of stamps only as we can take it to the post office once a month.
3. <1000 sales p.m., price of stamps and hiring the courier service to pick up our deliveries several times a month.

*NOTE.* this is separate from the cost of packaging the product, and hiring a staff member to look after sales fulfilment.
